                     <p><br>The following is an explanation of all current fees imposed, or, in the case of a late fee, may be imposed by Skiski in connection with a transaction via its Services. Failure to charge any of the below fees does not constitute a waiver of the right to impose a fee at any point in time. &nbsp;All fees included in this policy are subject to change.</p>
                     <h6>BOAT FEES</h6>
                     <p>The amount an Owner will identify in a Listing as the rental rate associated with the Boat.</p>
                     <h6>SERVICE FEES</h6>
                     <p>A service fee is charged on each rental in order to facilitate the transaction. The service fee is applied to the price identified in the Listing before any coupons or credits are applied to the final bill and is non-refundable.&nbsp;This fee helps Skiski provide a safer and more secure booking experience, as well as dedicated customer support throughout your charter.</p>
                     <h6>OWNER PAYOUT</h6>
                     <p>You’ll earn between 65% and 90% of the list price depending on your boat and insurance plan.</p>
                     <h6>PROCESSING FEES</h6>
                     <p>Skiski charges processing fees on any additional payments processed on behalf of the owner or renter. This includes fuel, damage/security deposit payments, or other miscellaneous charges. The current processing fee is 2.7% + $0.55 per charge.</p>
                     <h6>ADMINISTRATIVE FEES</h6>
                     <p>Skiski reserves the right to charge an additional $30 administrative fee for various issues such as chargebacks, disputes, or late fees. This is determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                     <h6>LATE FEE</h6>
                     <p>If a Renter returns a boat after the agreed rental period end time or arrives late to the start of the rental, they can be charged a late fee. This late fee is calculated by combining a one-time administrative fee of $30.00 plus the prorated hourly rental rate (based on the daily rental rate for the boat rented) plus applicable insurance charges.</p>
                     <h6>OWNER NO-SHOW / BOAT IN BAD CONDITION FEE</h6>
                     <p>If the Boat Owner does not show up to meet the Renter and make the Boat available for the Renter at the agreed upon rental start time or if the Boat is in an unacceptable condition, Skiski will treat this as an Owner cancellation and can charge the Owner up to $100 per no-show.</p>
                     <h6>RENTER NO-SHOW FEE</h6>
                     <p>If the Renter is a no-show within one hour of the agreed start time, the Owner has the ability to cancel the rental. Skiski will treat this as a Renter cancellation. The full cancellation policy can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.Skiski.com/legal/cancellation_policy">here</a>.</p>
                     <h6>REFUELING FEE</h6>
                     <p>In the case that the Owner’s fuel policy is not followed, Skiski will charge the Renter for fuel replaced as well as the standard $30 administrative fee.</p>
                     <h6>SECURITY DEPOSITS</h6>
                     <p>A minimum of $500 will be held for each rental as a security deposit. Owners reserve the right to charge higher deposits, which will be held on the Renter’s credit card to cover any incidental damage or lost items. The credit card hold will be released 72 hours after the rental period ends if no dispute or claim has been filed. In the case a claim is filed by the Owner, the security deposit will be captured and held until the claim is resolved. If Skiski is unable to capture a security deposit before the rental, the rental can be canceled.</p>
                     <p>For any claim event, the Renter’s security deposit will be captured to pay the insurance deductible, damages, and fees. Any portions of the security deposit that are unused will be refunded back to the Renter at the resolution of the claims process.</p>
                     <p>*Rental or commercial service fees and commissions are subject to change at any time.</p>
                     <h6>CHARGEBACK FEES</h6>
                     <p>Skiski reserves the right to charge a $15 chargeback fee to both the Renter and Owner depending on the type of chargeback. Additionally, Owners are 100% responsible for any amount disputed or charged back. When a chargeback occurs Skiski will stop payout on a rental until the chargeback is resolved. In the situation that an Owner has already received a payout related to a chargeback, Skiski will charge the Owner’s bank account for the chargeback amount and hold that amount in escrow until the chargeback is adjudicated. If the chargeback is won, Skiski will return the amount back to the Owner, less a $15 administrative fee. If the chargeback is lost, the money will not be returned and used to issue a refund. In this case, both Skiski and the Owner lose which makes being diligent on checking for fraudulent Renters even more important</p>
