               <p>Skiski Privacy Policy</p>
               <p>Last modified: August 22, 2018</p>
               <p>Skiski, a provider of a peer-to-peer Jet Ski charter marketplace, is committed to protecting your privacy and informing you about how your personal information is used.</p>
               <p>Our Privacy Policy helps explain our information practices. For example, we talk about what information we collect, use, and disclose about visits to our Services. &nbsp;We also collect information by other means (including offline) or from other sources, such as the equipment on Jet Ski you may rent.</p>
               <p>When we say “Skiski,” “our,” “we,” or “us,” we’re talking about Collaborative Jet Skiing, Inc., and its affiliates. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to your use of <a target="_blank" href="https://skiski.ca/">www.Skiski.com</a>, and any other websites, applications, features, software or services provided, owned, or operated by Skiski that link to this Privacy Policy (together, “Services”) unless specified otherwise. &nbsp;Please also read Skiski’s <a target="_blank" href="">Terms of Service Agreement</a> (“Terms”), which describes the terms under which you use our Services; capital terms used below that are not defined in this Privacy Policy are taken from the Terms.</p>
               <p>In the event of conflict or inconsistency between the Privacy Policy, and the Terms, the order of precedence will be: the Privacy Policy, and the Terms.</p>
               <p><br></p>
               <p><b>Change</b></p>
               <p>We may modify this Privacy Policy, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
               <p><br></p>
               <p><b>Information We Collect</b></p>
               <p>Skiski receives or collects information when we operate and provide our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services. &nbsp;We may also ask for your consent to process your personal information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you.

                  <li>
                     <p>Identity Verification. When you register with us or send a mobile text message to Skiski’s short code (69302) we may collect your instant messages (“IM”) screen name. &nbsp;A verification message may be sent to your mobile phone number, email address, and/or IM screen name and we require that you verify each piece of contact information.</p>

                  <li>
                     <p>Rental. When you rent or charter a Jet Ski, we may ask for, and store, your credit card number or billing information. &nbsp;We may also collect additional information from you such as your driving and criminal conviction history, loss history, and other information related to our underwriting process. &nbsp;We may also require that you grant us permission to check your driver’s record in order to confirm you meet Skiski’s eligibility standards (e.g., age). You authorize us to access your driver’s record from state DMVs, RMVs, and other applicable entities and you authorize those entities to release this information to Skiski.</p>
                  </li>

               <div><br></div>

                  <li>
                     <p>Mobile. &nbsp;When you download or use apps created by Skiski, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. &nbsp;We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <div><br></div>

                  <li>
                     <p>Communication. &nbsp;To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from us if your computer supports such capabilities. &nbsp;We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, sometimes in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to you. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please adjust your preferences in your Skiski Account.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                     <p>In-Jet Ski Hardware. &nbsp;If a GPS tracking device is installed in a Jet Ski, and you activate that device with Skiski, we may gather information about your use of the Jet Ski, including time of use, location, speed of travel, and more. &nbsp;When you rent or charter a Jet Ski, and the Jet Ski includes a GPS tracking device enabled by the owners of the Jet Ski, those owners may be able to see the location of the Jet Ski during the rental or charter period. Your location information may be released to insurance companies, law enforcement, or similar parties when investigating claims, providing you with help, or when required by law or legal process.</p>

                  <li>
                     <p>Listing Information. &nbsp;You have choices about the information on a listing profile, such as the city, a description of the Jet Ski, harbor where the Jet Ski is located. &nbsp;The information on your listing profile helps you get more from our Services, but it is your decision whether to post sensitive information. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available. &nbsp;If you own a Jet Ski that is listed with Skiski, we may require that you provide evidence of an inspection, survey of the Jet Ski, or, in addition, a Jet Ski history report. Listing a Jet Ski with us provides us authorization to obtain history about your Jet Ski and inspection records from other parties (e.g., mechanics, inspection companies), as well as consent for those parties to release records to us.</p>

               <p><b>Do Not Track</b></p>
               <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes. We do not, however, recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.</p>
