               <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
               <p></p>
               <hr>
               <p></p>
               <p>These terms and conditions govern the SKiski Cancellation Policy (the “Cancellation Policy”) available to Renters and Owners through the Services.</p>
               <p>SKiski has standardized cancellation policies that we will enforce to protect both Renter and Jet Ski Owner. Each party has the ability to cancel at any time. The fee schedule will be determined on the policy selected by the Owner and when the cancellation occurs in relationship to the reservation dates.</p>
               <p>The cancellation policies are as followed:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><b><i>Flexible</i></b><i></i></li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Free cancellations until 24 hours before the booking start date.<br></li>
                     <li>Cancellations within 24 hours of the booking start date are non-refundable.<br></li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><b><i>Moderate</i></b><br></li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Free cancellations until 5 days before the booking start date.<br></li>
                     <li>50% refund for cancellations between 2-5 days before the booking start date.<br></li>
                     <li>Cancellations within 2 days of the booking start date are non-refundable.<br></li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><b><i>Strict</i></b><br></li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Free cancellations until 30 days before the booking start date.<br></li>
                     <li>50% refund for cancellations between 14-30 days before the booking start date.<br></li>
                     <li>Cancellations within 14 days of the booking start date are non-refundable.</li>
                  </ul>
               </ul>
               <h3>Extenuating Circumstances</h3>
               <p>If a cancellation must be made outside the above time frames, SKiski will consider exceptions provided certain extenuating circumstances are shown. For the following extenuating circumstances, the Renter will receive a 100% refund and the Jet Ski Owner will not receive payment.</p>
               <p>Either party is able to cancel by contacting via a <a target="_blank" href="http://support.Jet Skibound.co/hc/en-us/requests/new">support ticket</a> to provide documentation to support the cancellation. Some examples of acceptable extenuating circumstances</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>A booking is within 150 miles of a named or numbered storm.</li>
                  <li>Safety-related cancellations stemming from the event of lightning, thunderstorms, heavy rain, or heavy wind within eight (8) hours of the time the of the scheduled rental.</li>
                  <li>Death in the family</li>
                  <li>Natural disaster</li>
                  <li>Political Unrest</li>
                  <li>An issue with the Jet Ski that causes your rental to end prematurely that is deemed to be the responsibility of the Owner. For such occurrences when the vessel is hired for multiple days a cancellation will be processed, pro rata, for the remainder of the rental if the condition is not fixed within 20% of the total remaining rental time, calculated from the first tender of notice to the Owner regarding the condition, which has made the vessel inoperable.</li>
                  <li>Owner cancellation, no-show, or no access to the Jet Ski. In this case, the Jet Ski Owner may be subject to penalties.</li>
                  <li>A problem arises during rental that causes the Renter to end the rental, and is determined to be due to negligence of the Owner. In this case, the Jet Ski Owner may be subject to penalties.</li>
                  <li>If the description of the Jet Ski in the listing on the Site is materially inaccurate with respect to:</li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>the size of the Jet Ski (e.g., number and size of the seating capacity, make, or model)</li>
                     <li>if another party, including the Owner, is using the Jet Ski during the reservation</li>
                     <li>special features represented in the listing description are not provided or do not function, such as engines, water, lights, bathrooms (toilet/shower/bathtub), kitchen (sink/stove/refrigerator or major other appliances), and electrical, heating or air condition systems</li>
                     <li>the physical location of the Jet Ski (proximity)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>In some cases, SKiski may need to cancel a trip after booking to protect our users against fraud or for trust and safety considerations. SKiski will notify both owners and renters in such an event. When SKiski must cancel a trip, renters will receive a full refund and owners are generally not eligible for earnings.<br></li>
               </ul>
               <h3>Charters Outside of the United States</h3>
               All bookings outside of the United States follow the Strict&nbsp;cancellation&nbsp;standard unless otherwise stated within their Jet Ski description.<br>
               <h3>Minimum Quality Standards &amp; Owner Responsibilities</h3>
               <p>If you are an Owner, you are responsible for ensuring that the Jet Skis you list on the Services meet minimum quality standards regarding access, adequacy of the description on the Services, safety, cleanliness, and do not present a Renter with travel issues. During the 24-hour period following the Renter’s check-in, Owners should be available, or make a third-party available, in order to try, in good faith, to resolve Renter issues.<br></p>
               <h3>Jet Ski Owner Penalties</h3>
               <p>We reserve the right to penalize Owners that cancel reservations or don’t meet minimum quality standards with the following penalties:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Black out the dates of canceled reservations</li>
                  <li>Apply fees equal to the Service Fees if there are more than one cancellation within a 6 month period</li>
                  <li>Lower the ranking of the Jet Ski listing in search results</li>
                  <li>Leave a review on the listing that the Owner canceled a rental.</li>
               </ul>
               <p><br></p>
               <h2>General Provisions</h2>
